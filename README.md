# clj-neo4j-procedures

Neo4j Stored Procedures + Functions implemented in Clojure

#### User-Defined Procedures

see `src/clj-neo4j-procedures/procedures.clj` for examples of user-defined stored procedures

#### User-Defined Functions

see `src/clj-neo4j-procedures/functions.clj` for examples of user-defined functions

## Why?

I wanted to be able to leverage the power of the graph, and the power of Clojure the programming language, and do it in a way that wasn't constrained to _only_ using cypher queries.  Cypher is great, and can be used directly to achieve many things. There were those times, though, that cypher felt somewhat constrained and limiting as soon as things got beyond the basics.

By exposing User-Defined Procedures & Functions to being able to be called from Clojure directly on the graph, it opens up interesting possibilities for what is possible to *elegantly* achieve.  

## Status

**WARNING**  _EXPERIMENTAL_

definitely **NOT** ready yet for primetime production usage

## Usage

`lein uberjar` will produce a jar file that you should place in the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder.   

Restart Neo4j for it to pick up your new plugin.

Now you can freely use your custom defined function(s) and procedure(s) directly in cypher.  e.g.:

```SQL
# In cypher-land, e.g.
CALL myplugin.myprocedure() YIELD ... 

RETURN myplugin.myfunction() AS ...  
```


#### Casting to Neo4J recognized types:

When declaring the input type hinting, the argument type must be, or must coerce to, one of the following:

`boolean`, `java.lang.Boolean`, `double`, `java.lang.Double`, `java.lang.Long`, `java.lang.Number`, `java.lang.Object`, `java.lang.String`, `java.util.List`, `java.util.Map`, `long`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.Node`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.Path`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.Relationship`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.spatial.Geometry`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.spatial.Point`


Neo4j Stored Procedures produce [Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html) of records. When declaring the record output type, each record must return a declared class containing, or before returning must coerce into, one (or more) of the following public non-final field types:

`String`, `Long`, `Double`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.Node`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.Relationship`, `org.neo4j.graphdb.Path`
`java.util.Map` with key `String` and value `Object`,
`java.util.List` of elements of any valid field type, including  `java.util.List`,
`Object` - meaning any of the valid field types


####

Procedures can have a few [modes](https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/3.1/javadocs/index.html?org/neo4j/procedure/Procedure.html)

`DBMS` `DEFAULT` `READ` `WRITE` `SCHEMA`
